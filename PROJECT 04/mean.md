# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATIOM (LEMP STACK) NGINX

### What is NGINX

#### NGINX is open-source web server software used for reverse proxy, load balancing, and caching. It provides HTTPS server capabilities and is mainly designed for maximum performance and stability. It also functions as a proxy server for email communications protocols, such as IMAP, POP3, and SMTP. 

# Benefits of NGINX

### 1. Reduces the waiting time to load a website. You don’t have to worry about high latency on your websites, therefore providing a good user experience. 

### 2. Speeds up performance by routing traffic to web servers in a way that increases the overall speed. This feature provides a good browsing experience to your users.

### 3. Acts as an inexpensive and robust load balancer.

### 4. Offers scalability and the ability to handle concurrent requests. 

### 5. Allows on-the-fly upgrades without downtime.

#  USE CASES

####  -A web server. This is the most common because of its performance and scalability.

####  -A reverse proxy server. NGINX does this by directing the client’s request to the appropriate back-end server. 

####  -A load balancer. It automatically distributes your network traffic load without manual configuration.

####  -An API gateway. This is useful for request routing, authentication, and exception handling.

####  -A firewall for web applications. This protects your application by filtering incoming and outgoing network requests on your server.

####  -A cache. NGINX acts as a cache to help store your data for future requests.

####  -Protection against distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

####  -K8s. These automate deployments and scaling and manage containerized applications.

####  -A sidecar proxy. This routes traffic to and from the container it runs alongside.
