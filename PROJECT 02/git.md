## What is Git:

#### Definition: Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning-fast performance. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become one of the most popular version control systems in use today. 

## Important Functions of Git:

### 1. Performance

#### The raw performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. Committing new changes, branching, merging, and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance. The algorithms implemented inside Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source code file trees, how they are usually modified over time, and what the access patterns are. Unlike some version control software, Git is not fooled by the names of the files when determining what the storage and version history of the file tree should be, instead, Git focuses on the file content itself. After all, source code files are frequently renamed, split, and rearranged. The object format of Git's repository files uses a combination of delta encoding (storing content differences), and compression and explicitly stores directory contents and version metadata objects.
