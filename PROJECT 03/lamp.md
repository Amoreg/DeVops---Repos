### What is web stack?

#### A web stack is the collection of software used for web development that incorporates, at a minimum, an operating system (OS), a programming language, database software, and a web server.

#### A web stack, also known as a web application stack, is a type of solution stack. It's a collection of software applications that perform a particular task. In this case, the task or purpose is to enable web development, that is, the development of websites and web applications.

#### The term stack is used because the system's components and technologies are built upon one another and work in tandem for web development projects. Moreover, the stack can be used repeatedly for multiple projects. Selecting the right web stack is important because the wrong choices can prove costly.
