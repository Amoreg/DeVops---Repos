# WEB STACK ( TECHNOLOGY STACK)

### What is web stack?

#### A web stack includes all of the hardware and software systems that are needed to develop and run a single website, web integration, or mobile application. Software developers can use a pre-configured technology stack as the platform for developing a new application, or they may design a technology stack by choosing and incorporating software that meets their unique requirements.

#### A web stack, also known as a web application stack, is a type of solution stack. It's a collection of software applications that perform a particular task. In this case, the task or purpose is to enable web development, that is, the development of websites and web applications.

#### The term stack is used because the system's components and technologies are built upon one another and work in tandem for web development projects. Moreover, the stack can be used repeatedly for multiple projects. Selecting the right web stack is important because the wrong choices can prove costly.

#  Roles of each component in a web stack? 

#### The web stack's components work together to ensure that the correct information is passed to a requesting client, which is usually an internet browser. 

### 1. OS: The OS in the web stack is the central interface between the hardware and software components of the web application. The most popular OSes for web development are Windows, Linux, Unix, and MacOS.

### WEBSERVER: 

#### The web server delivers web documents and information to the clients who request them. Client requests are passed to the web server via HTTP. The web server then directly processes the requests for static content or refers to a database and script module for dynamic content. Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and Nginx are all types of web servers.

### THE DATABASE :

#### The database is required to store the data for the web project and make it available to the web server as required. The server requests data using server extensions that generate the output in a suitable format, such as HTML, and forward it to the server. SQL, MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB are all popular databases for web projects.

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

#### The programming language, also known as the script interpreter, operates on the client side and within the requesting browser. It's required to realize dynamic websites and web applications. PHP is one of the most popular script interpreters; others include Java, Ruby, Perl and Python.
